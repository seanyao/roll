Roll — a Supervisor-led CLI harness that routes AI agents through story-scoped planning, building, evaluation, git, CI, and acceptance evidence. Works with Claude, Cursor, Codex, Kimi, Pi, Reasonix, and other local rigs when they are available.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://seanyao.github.io/roll/install | bash
```

```bash
npm install -g @seanyao/roll
```

Requirements: Node.js ≥ 22. Roll is a self-contained TypeScript CLI — no runtime engine beyond node.
On macOS, npm installation also tries to install `Roll Capture.app` from the
latest `seanyao/roll-capture` GitHub Release into `~/Applications` so physical
screenshots can run. If the release is private, the installer first tries
anonymous GitHub access, then retries with `GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GH_TOKEN` or
`gh auth token` when available; credentials are used only in request headers.
GitHub requests respect `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY`/`NO_PROXY` when Node exposes
the matching fetch dispatcher. CI, headless sessions, non-macOS hosts,
sudo/root shells, offline downloads, or `ROLL_SKIP_CAPTURE_INSTALL=1` skip this
step without failing install; when skipped under sudo/root, re-run `roll setup`
as a regular user so the app installs into that user's `~/Applications`.
`roll setup` and `roll doctor tools` report the same readiness and repair path.

## Use

```bash
cd your-project
roll init           # set up Roll here (interactive confirmation)
roll next           # continue with design, apply, repair, migrate, loop, or status
roll loop on        # let AI work through the backlog (optional)
```

`roll init` first diagnoses the current directory. Complete Roll projects get
`Already initialized` and `Next: roll status`; partial Roll projects get
`roll init --repair`, while pre-2.0 layouts get migration guidance without writing files. Existing codebases route to
`$roll-onboard`. PRD/docs-only workspaces are treated as new projects: Roll writes
`.roll/brief.md` from the detected document and points to
`roll design --from-file <detected-doc>`.
Empty directories ask what you are building in an interactive terminal; in scripts
and CI, plain `roll init` is read-only and `roll init --auto` writes a placeholder
brief before pointing to `roll design`.
For existing-codebase grafts, `roll init --apply` validates the generated
artifacts, prints a review checkpoint with every planned file operation, and
waits for owner confirmation before writing. Automation must use
`roll init --apply --auto` after that review.
After any init path, `roll next` is the continuation button: it reads the same
brief, onboard plan, backlog, and Roll markers, then prints one best next
command instead of a menu.
When `roll init` writes Roll-owned meta files inside a git worktree, it also
adds, commits, and pushes those files to `origin` when possible, then prints the
commit/push result. Product files you created yourself are not included in that
finalization commit.

## Language Surfaces

Roll renders one visible language per user surface. `ROLL_LANG=en|zh` pins the
current process, `roll config lang en|zh` persists a preference, and
`roll config lang --reset` returns to locale detection. `roll help --lang en|zh`
is available for one-off guide/help reads, and `roll doctor language` audits
docs, conventions, skills, and generated surfaces for mixed-language drift.

Agent contracts, code comments, git metadata, and TypeScript identifiers stay in
English as the harness contract layer. Owner conversation follows the owner's
language. User docs live in separate locale files under `guide/en/` and
`guide/zh/`; contributors should update the matching locale file or i18n catalog
instead of placing translation pairs in the same rendered surface. Snapshot
coverage for the current language controls lives in
`packages/cli/test/cli-language-surface.test.ts`,
`packages/cli/test/__snapshots__/cli-language-surface.test.ts.snap`, and
`packages/cli/test/doctor-language.test.ts`.

## V4 Supervisor Execution

Roll V4 separates project coordination from story delivery:

- **Supervisor** coordinates at project level: backlog order, cross-Story context, route advice, repeated failures, release readiness, budget, and owner escalation. It observes and advises; it does not implement a Story or override evidence gates.
- **Delta Unit** delivers one Story through scoped roles: `design` produces the Designer contract when the profile needs it, `execute` performs the Builder work, `evaluate` reviews/scores evidence, and `supervise` coordinates above the Story boundary.
- **supervise / design / execute / evaluate roles** are stable contracts. The concrete `agent` and optional `model` are resolved through the Agent Scope model: `Scope -> Role -> Binding -> Agent -> Model`.
- **Skills remain** the capability layer. Roles invoke `$roll-design`, `$roll-build`, `$roll-fix`, `$roll-peer`, `$roll-.qa`, and related skills instead of rewriting those contracts into TypeScript.
- **Fallback is fail-loud**. If a requested agent or rig is unavailable, Roll records that unavailability and pauses or asks for owner action; it does not silently pretend another agent was used.

### Supervisor backlog-clearing standard

When the owner asks Roll to clear a backlog, Supervisor treats the scope as every
live non-Hold `FIX-*`, `US-*`, and `REFACTOR-*` row unless the owner narrows it.
Before scheduling another card it reconciles backlog status, open PRs, recent
cycle endings, CI/evaluator gates, manual-merge PRs, and `.roll` meta state.
Each card gets its own Builder and, when required by the execution profile, an
independent Evaluator/Scorer selected from the current Agent roster. Repeated
failure, zero TCR, missing PR/CI/evaluator evidence, parser failures, auth
blocks, permission blocks, and `[roll:manual-merge]` PRs stop new scheduling and
surface an owner action through `roll supervisor status/next/why`.

### Operating modes

Roll has two product modes over the same backlog, truth, route profile, execution
profiles, evidence, Evaluator, and release gates:

- **guided** — the owner drives through `roll supervisor status/next/why` and
  starts work explicitly with commands such as `roll loop go --cards <id>`.
  Guided mode never silently starts long-running Story execution. When the
  scheduler is off, `roll loop go` runs a manual goal; when the loop is paused,
  use `roll loop resume` before scheduled work can continue.
- **autonomous** — `roll loop on` installs the scheduler; eligible Stories may
  be picked within the existing pause, budget, route, evidence, Evaluator, and
  release gates. `roll loop pause` / `roll loop off` return control to guided
  operation; `roll loop off --all` is the machine-wide emergency stop for every
  local `com.roll.*` LaunchAgent; `roll loop resume` / `roll loop on` switch
  back explicitly. If macOS launchd bootstrap fails, `roll loop on` exits
  unarmed and offers `roll loop fallback start --confirm` as an owner-confirmed,
  non-persistent fallback; repair launchd first when possible.
- **Attest and evidence are story-scoped**. A Story is accepted through its own Acceptance Review Page (`latest/<id>-review.html`), AC map, and screenshots/test artifacts. `latest/<id>-report.html` remains a legacy alias for one release cycle.

Agent bindings are declared in two files: `~/.roll/agents.yaml` for Machine Scope
and `.roll/agents.yaml` for Project Scope. A Project can inherit the machine pool
and bind Story roles:

```yaml
schema: roll-agents/v1
scope: project
inherits: machine
defaults:
  story:
    roles:
      execute:
        kind: select
        from: [kimi, codex, pi]
        require: [execute]
        strategy: first-available
      evaluate:
        kind: select
        from: [claude, codex, kimi, pi, agy, reasonix, cursor]
        require: [evaluate]
        strategy: health-aware
```

Machine Scope also owns the closed process-capacity policy shared by every
registered Workspace:

```yaml
schema: roll-agents/v1
scope: machine
agents:
  codex:
    capabilities: [supervise, execute, evaluate]
  kimi:
    capabilities: [execute, evaluate]
capacity:
  global: auto
  default_per_agent: 1
  agents:
    codex: 2
  heartbeat_seconds: 30
  stale_after_seconds: 120
```

When `capacity` is absent, each enabled machine agent gets one slot and the
global limit is their sum. Every Builder and adversarial role process acquires
one exact-owned lease before spawn. Exhaustion is a neutral wait: no agent is
spawned, the Story returns to Todo, and `roll loop status --all` shows the
agent/model/retry state without exposing credentials or provider health.

Runtime availability is explicit: if a candidate is not callable on the current
machine because of auth, network, VPN, or account state, the current resolution
records that limitation instead of rewriting the static pool.
Workspace execution uses a separate `machine -> workspace -> story -> skill`
chain. `<workspace>/agents.yaml` may only cast roles and refine Story/skill
defaults; machine declarations, models, disabled state, and readiness remain
machine-owned. Repository-local Project Scope is migration input only for a
Workspace run. Inspect the read-only effective trace with
`roll agent --workspace <id|path>`; `roll agent list` and `roll agent readiness`
always remain machine views.
For open role casting, `strategy: health-aware` keeps the installed pool visible
and ranks candidates by capability, recent health, successful deliveries, recent
use, and cost band. Inspect a cast with
`roll supervisor route --role builder --story <id> [--json]`; the trace lists
every candidate, warnings, skipped facts, reasons, and the selected agent.

## Onboarding Samples

**Zero-start project**

```bash
mkdir my-product && cd my-product
roll init
# In an interactive terminal, describe the requirement, point to a PRD,
# or let Roll write .roll/brief.md from detected notes.
roll next
roll design --from-file .roll/brief.md
roll loop on
```

Roll explains the next design step instead of inventing fake work. The Designer turns the requirement into Stories, the Supervisor chooses `standard`, `verified`, or `designed` execution, and the owner reviews story-scoped attest evidence.

**Existing project**

```bash
cd existing-codebase
roll init
roll next
roll init --apply        # after reviewing the generated onboard plan
roll loop on
```

Roll diagnoses the repository without destructive migration, writes or updates Roll metadata only after review, and then lets the Supervisor reason over existing backlog, docs, context, open PRs, and scoped role bindings. Current state is visible through CLI-first observability: `roll status`, `roll loop watch`, `roll loop runs`, `roll loop cycle <id>`, `roll loop alert`, and story reports.

## Quick start for new projects

A new project needs a remote before the loop can push branches and open PRs:

```bash
cd your-project
roll init
# 1. Create a GitHub repository for the project and add it as `origin`
# 2. Push the current branch so the loop has somewhere to land work
git push -u origin main
# 3. Start the autonomous loop
roll loop on
```

The loop will fail fast with an alert if the repository is missing or
unreachable, so it never burns agent tokens against a broken push target.  If
you need to stop the loop, `roll loop pause` persists a pause marker; resume
with `roll loop resume` when ready.

`roll agent cast`, `roll doctor tools`, `roll status ci`, `roll status pulse`,
`roll loop cycles`, `roll loop cycle`, `roll release showcase`, and `roll setup offboard`.
Historical top-level aliases for those capabilities now return the standard
unknown-command response.

## Observability Now

Roll's current observability is CLI-first. Persistent facts flow through one
read path: anchors -> selectors -> adapter -> projections. `roll status`,
`roll loop watch`, `roll loop runs`, `roll loop cycle <id>`, `roll status pulse`, and
story-scoped attest reports are the current user-facing truth surfaces.
Role and collaboration visibility are part of that same surface: `roll loop cycle <id> --roles`,
`roll loop cycle <id> --collab`, `roll loop cycle --legend`, `roll supervisor live --collab`,
and the Execution Cast report block expose selected/returned/accepted role outcomes.
The archive rebuild is an on-demand archive and repair renderer for static HTML pages;
it is not the active delivery truth surface.

- `roll status` starts with a compact North Star line. Read it as the same four
  `roll north` metrics in one row: autonomous runtime, delivery rate, fix tax,
  and attribution errors. A dot shows each metric's current state.
- `roll north` expands those readings into a 14-day panel. Targets are
  autonomous runtime >=72h, delivery rate >=60%, fix tax <1x, and attribution
  errors =0. The anti-gaming rules are part of the metric: an effective
  autonomous day needs at least 6 non-idle attempts, backlog-empty days pause
  the autonomy clock instead of counting against it, fix tax divides FIX work
  by US delivery only, and `unknown` attribution is not guessed. `null` means no
  usable data yet; the panel prints the reason.
- A backlog row is a claim; merge evidence on `main` and recorded acceptance
  evidence are truth. A premature `✅ Done` claim is shown as drift.
- Failures are attributed as `env`, `harness`, `card`, or `unknown`. Repeated
  non-card root causes pause dispatch by root cause and write a diagnostic
  snapshot with a playbook. When you see dispatch paused, read the snapshot,
  repair the environment or Roll component named there, then resume. If a card
  was parked because old env/harness failures polluted skip accounting, use
  `roll loop pardon-skip-list [--dry-run] [--include-unknown]` to rebuild the
  skip list from runs and events.
- Builder cycles keep the main checkout physically read-only while the Builder
  runs. Dirty or ahead changes that leak into the main checkout are quarantined
  onto `rescue/leaked-*` refs with a manifest under `.roll/loop/quarantine/`.
  The manifest names the files and includes the restore command to claim the
  rescued work.
- Cycle history is read through the TerminalOutcome vocabulary, not legacy
  free-form summary text.
- Missing facts render as `?`. A visible `0` means a known zero, not unknown.

Evidence gates are strict for merge. `attest render` failure, dangling
`ac-map.json` paths, `claimed` AC statuses, and a non-exempt visual card with no
captured screenshot can block merge. PR bodies carry a `Roll-Evidence` trailer
so reviewers can jump to the story evidence. Run `roll attest audit [--json]`
to find dangling evidence references and `evidence_debt` rows. See
[Acceptance evidence](guide/en/acceptance-evidence.md) and
[Loop failure handling](guide/en/loop.md#failure-attribution-and-pauses).

Visual evidence is **best-effort**: a visual AC is satisfied by either a
**Roll Capture · physical** image or a target-bound **Playwright · rendered**
receipt — a physical image is not the only thing that can satisfy it. Evidence
health is one of four states: `verified`, `degraded-infrastructure` (capture
machine broken — published, marked degraded, **never rebuilt**), `invalid-target`
(blocks), or `absent-contract` (blocks). Receipts never include credentials,
cookies, DOM, or network bodies, capture is window-scoped, and `ROLL_NO_SCREENCAP`
bans only the runner's native path. Enable best-effort with the capability-gated,
reversible `roll capture migrate`; repair a degraded record without reopening the
build via `roll capture repair <story-id>`; and check readiness with `roll doctor`
or `roll capture status`.

Behavior Roll cannot prove locally — a real `npm i -g github:...`, a published
CLI's first run, a live OAuth callback — must declare an `external-smoke` or
`owner-attested` verification path. The attest report shows an **Outward
verification** banner: only a real smoke pass (or valid owner attestation) is
green; `verified-in-simulation` (e.g. `npm pack`) and `UNVERIFIED — external
smoke not run` are never green, so acceptance cannot overstate outward behavior.
No real publish or account action ever runs without a declared authority. See
[Outward behavior verification](guide/en/acceptance-evidence.md#outward-behavior-verification).

`roll supervisor live` is the shipped CLI-first multi-role board. It prints a
one-frame snapshot for scripts and quick inspection; `roll supervisor live --watch`
keeps the same board open and redraws it in-place from the same event-backed view
model. A browser/TUI Supervisor Live Console remains future work and must reuse
that view model.

skills/        Git submodule → seanyao/roll-skills (the agent skill contracts)
conventions/   Conventions synced into AI clients by `roll setup`
template/      Project scaffolding installed by `roll init`
