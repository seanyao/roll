# Workspace-first delivery

A Workspace is Roll's local requirement, planning, execution and unified
delivery boundary. A repository is a code resource bound to that Workspace; it
is not the project identity and it is not a second Roll control plane.

One machine can keep multiple active Workspaces. Every mutating command resolves
exactly one target, while explicitly documented `--all` views remain read-only.

## Mental model

```text
Machine
├── Agent capabilities and capacity
├── Workspace registry
├── Shared repository caches
└── Workspaces
    ├── requirements + backlog
    ├── Story / Issue records
    └── runtime projections
```

The stable `workspaceId` is identity. The registry maps that ID to a canonical
path, so moving a Workspace changes location, not identity. There is no global
current Workspace and no singleton active slot.

Repository caches live at `~/.roll/repos/<repoId>.git`. They are disposable,
machine-shared bare caches. Deleting or rebuilding one must not change backlog,
Issue completion, merge evidence or integration acceptance.

## Create and activate a Workspace

Write one versioned `roll.workspace-create/v1` config outside the target root,
then preview the deterministic plan:

```bash
roll workspace create ws-payments --config /absolute/path/workspace-create.yaml --check --json
```

`--check` is read-only. It validates identity, root, requirement bindings,
repository remotes, aliases, integration branches, cache decisions and existing
content. Apply only the reviewed config:

```bash
roll workspace create ws-payments --config /absolute/path/workspace-create.yaml --json
roll workspace activate ws-payments
```

Initialization creates the Workspace authorities and repository bindings. It
does not create a persistent product checkout. It also does not imply that the
Workspace is the command target: activation controls scheduler eligibility,
while each command still resolves its own target.

Inspect lifecycle state without mutation:

```bash
roll workspace list --all --json
roll workspace show ws-payments --json
```

## Target resolution and fail-loud behavior

Workspace-aware commands accept `--workspace <id|path>`. Resolution considers
the explicit flag, `ROLL_WORKSPACE`, the current directory and active registry
entries. Those signals must converge on one Workspace.

Examples:

```bash
roll backlog --workspace ws-payments
roll loop status --workspace ws-payments
roll agent --workspace ws-payments
roll delivery list --workspace ws-payments
```

If two Workspaces are active and no stronger selector resolves the command,
Roll reports the candidates and exits non-zero. Conflicting explicit,
environment and cwd selectors also fail loud. Mutations such as `pause`,
`archive`, scheduler control and delivery reconciliation reject `--all`.

Planning and delivery commands use the selected Workspace as their only
project-data authority. They can run from an arbitrary directory without
creating `<cwd>/.roll`:

```bash
roll story new US-PAY-102 --title "Retry refund" --epic payments --workspace ws-payments
roll idea "improve refund diagnostics" --workspace ws-payments
roll design "split refund recovery" --workspace ws-payments
roll attest US-PAY-102 --workspace ws-payments
roll capture status --workspace ws-payments --json
roll truth query US-PAY-102 --workspace ws-payments --json
```

These commands and their internal view refresh read or write `backlog/index.md`,
`features/`, `policy.yaml`, `evidence/`, `runtime/` and the derived `index.json`
under the canonical Workspace. A mutation fails closed when its required
authority is missing or has the wrong type; it never falls back to creating a
new `.roll` tree. Symlinked authorities or internal mutation paths are rejected
before Roll reads or writes through them. A legacy `.roll` project is migration input only; Roll never
writes both layouts.

`roll idea` writes the Story card and a canonical linked backlog row, so the
result is immediately readable with `roll backlog show <ID> --workspace ...`.
Imported backlog links that still start with `.roll/features/` are resolved
read-only against canonical `features/`; the backlog is not silently rewritten.

## Requirement and Issue layout

A requirement revision is captured before execution and remains attributable to
its provider reference and digest. A Story contract in `backlog/` becomes one
Issue when execution starts:

```text
<workspace>/
├── requirements/<provider>/<requirement>/
├── backlog/.../<storyId>/spec.md
└── issues/<storyId>/
    ├── manifest.json
    ├── events.ndjson
    ├── <repoAlias>/
    ├── artifacts/
    └── evidence/
```

Create or repair repository worktrees only through the Issue command:

```bash
roll workspace issue init US-PAY-101 --workspace ws-payments --check --json
roll workspace issue init US-PAY-101 --workspace ws-payments --json
```

Writable code exists only in `issues/<storyId>/<repoAlias>/` worktrees. A
read-only repository target can provide context without becoming a required
delivery leg. A partial setup failure rolls back clean new state and does not
spawn a Builder.

## One Story, independent repository facts

Story and Issue are the unified delivery unit. Roll does not introduce a
Delivery Set, a Workspace-level codebase, or a superproject to make unrelated
repositories appear physically atomic.

Each required repository independently records:

- its governed branch and TCR commits;
- provider PR state and required CI checks;
- the authoritative merge commit.

The Issue is delivered only when every required repository is merged and the
integration command passes against the exact merged SHAs. A single merged PR,
a local branch, a worktree, a green unit test or a backlog `Done` claim is not
enough.

Use the shared Issue fold:

```bash
roll delivery show US-PAY-101 --workspace ws-payments
roll delivery reconcile US-PAY-101 --workspace ws-payments --dry-run --json
roll delivery reconcile US-PAY-101 --workspace ws-payments
```

`roll delivery reconcile` folds Issue events and provider/main facts, refreshes
the Requirement attest projection, and then updates backlog as a projection. It
never treats backlog Markdown as completion truth. `roll loop reconcile` is an
alias over the same fold, not a second parser.

## Local-only campaign gate

For a campaign that must finish local acceptance before any external mutation,
configure the dedicated integration branch with `publish_mode: local`. This
mode runs the same local evidence gate and lands commits on the configured local
integration branch; it does not push branches or open a PR. Keep the gate in
place until all dependent Stories and the requirement-level critical flow pass
on one exact integration-branch SHA. Switching back to `remote` is a separate
owner-approved publication decision.

## Mandatory historical migration

A repository-local `.roll/` is historical input, not a second supported runtime
mode. Do not initialize a competing Workspace over it. First stop active
runtime, make product Git clean and remotely reachable, then collect a read-only
plan:

```bash
roll workspace migrate --from . --check
roll workspace migrate --from . --workspace ws-payments --check --json > workspace-migration-plan.json
```

Migration fails loud for dirty or unpushed product Git, an in-flight Git
operation, unsafe linked worktrees or recursive submodules, active runtime,
symlinks under `.roll`, unverifiable remote truth, or cache/registry conflicts.

If `.roll` is tracked by the product repository, remove exactly the planned
paths through the normal reviewed TCR/PR/push cutover. Apply then proves the
dedicated cutover commit is remotely reachable and that every saved digest still
matches. Ordinary tracked metadata leaves `.roll/RELOCATED.json` so the old
path cannot silently continue as a repository-local runtime.

Apply the exact owner-saved plan:

```bash
roll workspace migrate --from . --workspace ws-payments --plan workspace-migration-plan.json
```

The transaction writes its journal before side effects, maps requirements,
design, backlog and evidence directly into the Workspace, creates or reuses only
the machine bare cache, verifies digests, and registers/activates last. It never
creates a Workspace-level product checkout. Before registration, `--rollback`
can restore atomically moved source files.

If `.roll` is an independent Git repository, Roll copies the mapped content but
does not link, commit or push that repository. The command prints a
manual roll-meta handoff for the owner-approved metadata workflow.

## Diagnose and recover

```bash
roll workspace doctor ws-payments --json
```

Doctor reads registry/manifest consistency, cache identity, Requirement
projections and archive trust, Issue journals/worktrees, runtime locks and
machine capacity. Diagnosis is read-only. Only one named typed repair is allowed
per invocation; provider facts, immutable Requirement archives and Issue
completion evidence are never invented or deleted.

See [configuration](configuration.md), [Workspace doctor](workspace-doctor.md),
[the loop](loop.md), and [historical migration](legacy-onboarding.md) for the
detailed supporting contracts.
