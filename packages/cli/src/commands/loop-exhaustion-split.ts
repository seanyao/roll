/**
 * `roll loop exhaustion-split <story-id> [reason]`
 *
 * FIX-931 — agent-exhaustion auto-split (self-heal chain 3/4). After FIX-930's
 * agent rotation has exhausted every rig on a card (all gave up zero-TCR /
 * stalled), the loop used to skip-list it and wait for a human. Instead — mirror
 * US-AGENT-041 (review-resize) as a TRIGGER EDGE over the EXISTING splitter:
 * `$roll-design` mints ≥2 smaller sub-stories from the card's spec, then
 * `roll loop self-downgrade` (US-AGENT-042) parks the parent 🚫 Hold, appends the
 * children, closes the open PR, emits `story:split`, and — on cap-hit (chain
 * depth ≥ CHAIN_DEPTH_CAP) or an irreducible <2-sub split — refuses and raises an
 * ALERT for human triage. The chain-depth cap (US-AGENT-009) lives in
 * self-downgrade; this adds NO new counter, NO new splitter.
 *
 * Unlike review-resize there is NO heterogeneous-consensus gate: the exhaustion
 * signal is mechanical (every agent failed the card), so the cap/irreducible →
 * ALERT path is the safety, not a vote.
