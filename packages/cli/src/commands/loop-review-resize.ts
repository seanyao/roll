/**
 * `roll loop review-resize <story-id>`
 *
 * US-AGENT-041 — the reviewer-triggered self-downgrade. After a delivery is
 * scored, if the independent reviewer flagged the SCOPE as too large (a
 * `RESIZE:` signal on a LOW score — see review-resize.ts), this re-splits the
 * story instead of letting it idle as a low-confidence "done":
 *
 *   1. `$roll-design` mints sub-stories from the reviewer's enumerated gaps.
 *   2. The split PROPOSAL is reviewed by ≥2 HETEROGENEOUS agents (reusing the
 *      peer-review spawn) — all agree → auto-land; any objection → pause + alert
 *      (human on the loop, not in it; [[feedback_hetero_consensus_replaces_human_confirm]]).
 *   3. On consensus, the split is handed to `roll loop self-downgrade`
 *      (US-AGENT-042): parent → 🚫 Hold, sub-stories appended, open PR closed,
 *      `story:split` recorded. The chain-depth cap (US-AGENT-009) lives in that
 *      command — NO new counter here.
 *
 * This is the TRIGGER EDGE only: every mechanism (design, peer review,
 * self-downgrade, the cap) is reused. The deep cycle/gate path is untouched —
 * this runs POST-cycle, so a stale claim has already been released; landing the
 * split simply re-parks the parent at Hold.
