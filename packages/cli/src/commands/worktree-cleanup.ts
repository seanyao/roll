/**
 * FIX-1273 — `roll worktree cleanup`: safe recovery for branch-canary historical
 * worktree pressure.
 *
 * The branch/worktree canary counts every ephemeral branch + every dir under
 * `.roll/loop/worktrees` and pauses the loop over threshold — INCLUDING inactive
 * worktrees deliberately preserved for unpublished commits or dirty recovery.
 * `roll worktree audit` already proves whether a worktree is a merged, clean
 * `disposable_candidate`, but offered no actionable safe cleanup, so operators
 * force-removed by hand.
 *
 * This command adds a plan/apply route whose SOLE authority is the existing
 * audit. It NEVER removes a path merely because it is old or counted by the
 * canary — a canary count is never translated into a blanket deletion.
 *
 *   - `--dry-run` (default): print the exact counted refs/dirs, their audit
 *     disposition, and the MINIMAL candidate set needed to return under the
 *     canary threshold. It never mutates git state.
 *   - `--apply`: re-run the audit immediately before EVERY removal and require
 *     the same path + head + inactive + no-tracked-dirt + merged-ancestry +
 *     `disposable_candidate` disposition. It removes only that verified worktree
 *     through git, prunes registration, and emits structured events. A changed
 *     head, new dirt, missing path, or concurrent activation fails closed
 *     (fail-loud refusal) without substituting a preserved worktree.
 *
 * Data contract: {@link WorktreeCleanupPlan}, {@link WorktreeCleanupResult}.
