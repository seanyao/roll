/**
 * REFACTOR-056 — the ONE command-surface truth source.
 *
 * Roll's public CLI is a short list of product nouns and actions. A command is
 * public only when a human owner should remember it as part of the main
 * workflow; everything else is nested under an owner, kept internal/machine-only,
 * or removed (historical compatibility is not a retention reason). This registry
 * records that decision once, typed, so help, docs, site, and release-consistency
 * checks can stop drifting from each other.
 *
 * Plan: .roll/features/cli-simplification/command-surface-consolidation-plan.md
 *
 * Scope of THIS card: declare the typed registry and project the public
 * top-level list into `roll --help`. Later cards (REFACTOR-057..059) consume the
 * `target`/`owner` fields to actually move routes, drop retired aliases, and
 * refresh docs — no command behavior is migrated here.
