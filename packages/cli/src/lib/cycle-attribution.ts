/**
 * FIX-1060 — durable cycle→story/agent attribution recovery from events.ndjson.
 *
 * When a cycle is aborted externally (signal teardown, exception fallback) the
 * live {@link CycleContext} may already be gone. The events file, however, was
 * appended as the cycle progressed: `evidence:frame-opened` records the picked
 * story, `cycle:start` records the routed agent, `agent:stall` records the agent,
 * etc. This module recovers the best-known attribution by scanning those rows.
 */

/**
 * Recover the best-known story/agent for `cycleId` from `eventsPath`.
 *
 * Reads the whole ndjson file (it is append-only and typically < few MB) and
 * returns the last non-empty `storyId` / `agent` seen on an event whose
 * `cycleId` matches. Returns `{}` when the file is missing, unreadable, or
 * contains no attribution for the cycle.
 *
 * LENIENT: malformed lines are skipped; the helper must never throw, because
 * it runs on abort/signal paths where throwing would mask the original failure.
