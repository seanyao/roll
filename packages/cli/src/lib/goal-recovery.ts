/**
 * FIX-1049 — supervised recovery from a no-progress stop.
 *
 * The dead-loop breaker (loop-go.ts) STOPS a goal after K consecutive
 * whole-goal no-progress cycles or once every scope card is skipped. That is the
 * fail-loud backstop — an unmergeable card can never spin forever. But a stopped
 * goal used to be an OPAQUE dead end: the persisted `progress` (skippedCards /
 * zeroStreaks / noProgressCycles) makes the next `roll loop go` re-trip the
 * breaker instantly (`no_progress_on_all_cards`), so the routed NEXT eligible
 * Builder never runs without the operator hand-deleting `.roll/loop/goal.yaml`.
 *
 * This module is the PURE core of the supervised recovery path:
 *   1. {@link detectNoProgressStall} reads the persisted goal + event stream and,
 *      when the goal is stopped by no-progress, projects the auditable facts
 *      (blocked cards, per-card zero-delivery streaks, last failed Builder, the
 *      bounded handoff reference to a dirty-worktree/zero-TCR cycle).
 *   2. {@link planNoProgressRecovery} decides — given the next eligible Builder
 *      resolved by the caller — whether a supervised retry is `allowed` (a
 *      different Builder can be tried) or `denied` (no alternate Builder; the
 *      breaker correctly holds). It NEVER auto-clears: the decision is the
 *      operator's, this just adjudicates it.
 *   3. {@link clearStallForRecovery} produces the new `progress` block that frees
 *      ONE more attempt for the target card (drops its skip + zero streak, resets
 *      the whole-goal counter) without erasing the OTHER cards' accounting.
 *
 * IO (reading goal.yaml, resolving the route, writing events) lives in the
 * `loop-recover` command; this file is deterministic and unit-tested in
 * isolation.
