 * fresh BLOCKING file description, NOT fd 0. On Node v26 + macOS an interactive
 * stdin (fd 0) is non-blocking / Node-managed, so `readSync(0)` returns EAGAIN
 * before the typed line lands and a naive byte loop silently aborts. A freshly
 * opened `/dev/tty` blocks until the user answers; fd 0 is the piped/CI
 * fallback (EOF-terminated). EAGAIN is polled (bounded), never bailed on.
