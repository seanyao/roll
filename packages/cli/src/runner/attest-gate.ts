/**
 * FIX-207 — the acceptance-report (attest) gate.
 *
 * Skill 10.6 ("write the verification report") was a TEXT instruction: a cycle
 * could ship a high-quality delivery and silently skip the acceptance report
 * (observed 2026-06-06, cycle 20260606-033442 — FIX-199 merged with no ac-map,
 * no report, no review-score). Same failure mode FIX-150b fixed for peer review:
 * text has no teeth. This turns the requirement into a RUNTIME MECHANISM that
 * runs in every cycle's capture step, agent-agnostic:
 *
 *   actual delivery (commits ahead, real story)  AND  no fresh acceptance report
 *     ⇒ ALERT + an `attest:gate` event in events.ndjson (auditable forever).
 *
 * HARD by default: a delivery without dense, fresh acceptance evidence is
 * BLOCKED (the capture fails so the story is not marked Done). The temporary
 * migration hook is `loop_safety.attest_gate: soft` in policy.yaml.
 *
 * Freshness contract: the report at `.roll/verification/<storyId>/latest/report.html`
 * must have been written THIS cycle (mtime ≥ cycle start). A stale report left by
 * a previous delivery of the same story does not count as evidence.
 *
 * Content floor (US-ATTEST-012): freshness alone is mere "存在性". A fresh report
 * that is an EMPTY SHELL — parseable but with zero AC sections / no ac-map (the
 * FIX-214 case, where a heading naming another card stole all the AC) — is also
 * "skipped", not "produced". A real delivery's report carries ≥1 AC + an ac-map.
 *
 * Red-assertion floor (FIX-295): a `fail` AC — a check that EXECUTED AND went
 * red — blocks the delivery unconditionally. `main` is PR-protected and always
 * green, so a red check on a cycle branch is a regression the cycle introduced,
 * never an "environmental" quirk; it cannot be waived. The honest non-execution
 * exceptions (a `blocked` AC, a machine capture skip) are NOT failures and stay
 * waivable as before.
