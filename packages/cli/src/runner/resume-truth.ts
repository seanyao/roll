 * agent's edit lands in the REAL `.roll`. If the cycle never merges (it failed,

 * just claimed and (in a non-merged terminal) the agent just falsely flipped, so
 * it is distinct from a genuine pre-card-era Done (which is never this cycle's
 * picked story). We revert ONLY when the row is currently ✅ Done; a delivered
 * row that already rests at 🔨 In Progress (pending merge) is left untouched.
 * The target is the pre-cycle status captured at pick time (typically 📋 Todo);
