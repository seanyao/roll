/**
 * FIX-930 — per-story self-heal agent-rotation budget (the anti-oscillation
 * backbone).
 *
 * When a cycle gives up with ZERO TCR (the agent ran but produced nothing), the
 * loop does NOT immediately PAUSE — it swaps to the next untried agent
 * ({@link resolveRouteExcluding}) and re-marks the story `📋 Todo` so the next
 * cycle re-picks it with a fresh agent. This store is what makes that bounded and
 * non-oscillating: it remembers WHICH agents were already tried on a story (so
 * the swap excludes them) and HOW MANY swaps have happened (so it stops after
 * {@link SELFHEAL_AGENT_BUDGET}).
 *
 * It MUST survive ACROSS cycles (a per-cycle counter would reset every pick and
 * the loop would ping-pong kimi↔pi↔reasonix forever) and clear ONLY on genuine
 * delivery (done/published/local) — {@link clearSelfHeal} is called alongside
 * `clearCardFailure`. Runtime-only: `.roll/loop/selfheal-cards.json`, gitignored
 * like skip-cards.json / consecutive-fails; it NEVER mutates backlog truth.
