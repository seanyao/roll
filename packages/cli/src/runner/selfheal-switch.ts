/**
 * FIX-930 — the zero-TCR agent-switch decision + actuation, factored out of the
 * loop-run-once driver so it is unit-testable with injected ports (no real spawn,
 * no real clock; the budget store is an injected runtime dir).
 *
 * When a cycle gives up with zero TCR (the routed agent ran but produced nothing,
 * or stalled), the loop should try the NEXT untried agent in the tier chain
 * before treating it as a failure. {@link maybeSwitchAgent} is the decision: it
 * returns `true` ONLY when it has committed a swap (recorded the failed agent,
 * re-marked the story Todo, emitted `agent:retry`). The caller then returns 0
 * WITHOUT ticking the consecutive-failure counter — a self-heal is not a systemic
 * failure. It returns `false` when the per-story budget is spent OR the roster is
 * exhausted (every routable agent already tried), so the caller escalates
 * (FIX-931 split / PAUSE).
 *
 * The next cycle's route resolution (executor route port) re-applies the SAME
 * exclusion via resolveRouteExcluding(triedAgents), so the re-picked story routes
 * the fresh agent deterministically — the decision here and the actuation there
 * agree by construction.
