/**
 * FIX-363 (loop resilience) — the runtime poison-pill skip-list.
 *
 * Before this, the cron loop (`roll loop run-once`) auto-PAUSED the WHOLE loop
 * after 3 consecutive failures. One un-deliverable card therefore halted every
 * other card and forced the owner to intervene every time. This module isolates
 * a poison pill instead: a card that fails K times is recorded here, the picker
 * (`pickStory` `shouldSkip`) skips it, and the loop keeps delivering OTHER cards.
 * The whole-loop PAUSE is reserved for genuinely SYSTEMIC failure (different
 * cards failing in a row), which the per-card isolation lets through unchanged.
 *
 * Runtime-only: `.roll/loop/skip-cards.json` is gitignored (like consecutive-fails
 * / PAUSE markers). It NEVER mutates backlog truth — the card stays `📋 Todo`; the
 * skip is a runtime overlay an owner clears (or that {@link clearCardFailure}
 * drops on a successful delivery) to re-arm the card. So a transient bad night
 * self-heals on the next clean checkout without losing the card.
