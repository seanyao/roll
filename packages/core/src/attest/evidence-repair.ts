/**
 * US-EVID-032 — Evidence-only repair (AC2).
 *
 * A `degraded-infrastructure` delivery is a COMPLETED story whose capture
 * machine was broken (host/provider/tooling failures) — NOT a product failure
 * (best-effort-capture-plan.md → "Gate semantics"). Such a story must never be
 * rebuilt; instead its evidence can be repaired by re-running ONLY the capture
 * lanes and re-resolving evidence health, leaving the delivery verdict and the
 * build/TCR cycle completely untouched.
 *
 * This module is that repair, expressed purely over the reusable US-EVID-030
 * CapturePlanner + US-EVID-031 EvidenceHealth resolver. It carries the prior
 * delivery verdict through UNCHANGED and it has no dependency on — and never
 * invokes — TCR, the build, or the cycle. `reopenedBuild` is structurally always
 * false: an evidence-only repair cannot rebuild delivery.
