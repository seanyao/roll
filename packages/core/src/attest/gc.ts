/**
 * US-META-001 — archive GC verdict (pure).
 *
 * A card folder accrues one run dir per attest (`<run-id>/` + screenshots +
 * evidence), never overwritten. Left unbounded the heavy assets (screenshots)
 * pile up. The retention rule keeps the freshest runs and ages out the rest:
 *
 *   keep  iff  rank < keepLatest         (always keep the freshest N)
 *         OR   age <= keepDays           (recent runs survive regardless of rank)
 *   delete otherwise                     (old AND beyond the keep-N window)
 *
 * Conservative by construction: a run survives if EITHER it is one of the latest
 * N OR it is younger than the day window — only the old-and-surplus tail is cut.
 * Pure: the caller supplies `nowSec` and the runs' mtimes; this decides, the
 * command executes (mirrors loop/recovery's gcRetentionVerdict split).
