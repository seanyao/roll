/**
 * US-TRUTH-005 — the release consistency gate + recorded waivers (pure).
 *
 * The shadow audit (US-TRUTH-002) quantified drift; once its false positives
 * are gone the same findings become a release blocker: shipping past a
 * fail-level drift requires an OWNER WAIVER that is itself a fact —
 * reason, scope, expiry, operator, timestamp — appended to the event stream
 * (release_waiver anchor: an un-recorded bypass is itself drift; an expired
 * waiver no longer waives).
 *
 * Severity policy (AC2):
 *   fail          → blocks, unless an unexpired waiver matches
 *   warn          → allows (reported)
 *   unknown       → allows (external API flake / convergence windows must not
 *                   kill releases — the documented unknown policy)
 *   grandfathered → allows (history is listed, never a blocker)
