/**
 * US-CYCLE-009 — async delivery: take PR merge + reconcile OFF the critical path.
 *
 * The cycle runner, after opening a PR, ATTACHES auto-merge and RETURNS
 * immediately (it never blocks on CI). GitHub merges the PR when its checks go
 * green; a later `git fetch` / `git ls-remote` observation confirms the merge on
 * the GIT PLANE, and THAT confirmation — never a `gh` stdout grep — drives the
 * reconcile write-back (backlog flip + evidence + roll-meta push).
 *
 * This module holds the PURE decisions of that flow (no filesystem, no network,
 * no clock, no side effects — exhaustively unit-testable):
 *   - {@link planAutoMergeAttachArgv} / {@link matchHeadCommitSha} — the
 *     head-sha-pinned `gh pr merge --auto --squash` attach argv (AC1).
 *   - {@link confirmMergeFromGitPlane} — merge truth ONLY from git-plane facts
 *     (branch tip is an ancestor of main, or the branch net patch-id is on
 *     main). NEVER a `gh` stdout grep (AC2).
 *   - {@link mayDeleteSourceBranch} — the source branch is deletable ONLY after a
 *     verified merge (AC3).
 *   - {@link nextWritebackRetry} — bounded retry schedule for the write-back
 *     (AC3).
 *   - {@link shouldWriteBackOnMergeConfirmed} — idempotency: a duplicate
 *     merge-confirmed observation must NOT double-flip (AC4).
