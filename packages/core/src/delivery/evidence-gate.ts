/**
 * US-DELIV-004 — push-time evidence gate (fail-loud).
 *
 * Design .roll/features/delivery-reconciler/delivery-reconciler-design.md
 * §3.2/§4/§8: BEFORE the cycle branch is pushed, verify the acceptance
 * evidence (attest report + ac-map) was actually produced this cycle.
 * Missing evidence ⇒ `{ ok:false, reasons }` ⇒ the cycle is
 * `blocked_no_evidence` and the branch is NEVER pushed — "pushed a branch
 * but opened no PR" (裸分支无 PR) stops being a normal outcome and becomes a
 * fault state, handled like the zero-TCR class.
 *
 * This gate moves the CHECKPOINT earlier (push time instead of after-the-fact
 * attest); it does NOT change the attest judgement itself (FIX-329: attest is
 * earned at delivery, never backfilled). The CLI resolves the two facts from
 * disk (report/ac-map existence in either evidence root) and injects them;
 * the verdict is pure + total so it is exhaustively unit-testable.
 *
 * FIX-1256: the evidence gate must share the SAME "does this story owe an
 * acceptance report?" decision as the attest gate. A card with no `**AC:**`
 * block is exempt from both report and ac-map requirements; the caller injects
 * that via `acceptanceReportRequired`.
