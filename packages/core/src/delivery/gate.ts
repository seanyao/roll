 * Delivery gate — pure, injectable guard that prevents false "delivered"

 *
 * FIX-1032a: v4 first-trial (intel-radar US-TASK-001, cycle 20260629-112437-39253)
 * exposed a false-delivered condition: PR merged but main CI red → delivery
 * marked `delivered` on broken code
 *      that had already been merged to main.
 *
 * This gate blocks both, produces structured alerts, and is injectable
 * (zero I/O) so fixture tests can cover all three states without real network
 * calls or launchd probes.
