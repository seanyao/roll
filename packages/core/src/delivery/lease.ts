/**
 * US-DELIV-005 — one-card-one-lease: the picker's delivery-lease consult.
 *
 * Root cause addressed: same-card fan-out waste (the ir-pipeline failure — 3
 * agents racing one card, only one merge lands, the rest is discarded work).
 * Quality redundancy comes from the adversarial pair INSIDE one cycle
 * (US-LOOP-100..106), NOT from parallel duplicate builds.
 *
 * Model (design §4):
 *   - A lease is DERIVED from the event stream, never hand-written: each
 *     cycle's DeliveryState projection (projectDeliveryState) maps to a
 *     story-level DeliveryLeaseState. Terminal superseded/abandoned holds no
 *     lease; an ENDED cycle without a terminal delivery state releases its
 *     in_flight lease — a legal fix-forward retry of the same card is NOT
 *     parallel fan-out and must stay pickable.
 *   - `deliveryLease(storyId, leases)` is the pure pre-pick consult: a card
 *     held in any lease state → pick:false with reason + heldBy. `--race` is
 *     the explicit opt-in for parallel racing.
 *   - `siblingCancelEvents` is the race resolution: on the FIRST merge, every
 *     remaining sibling lease on that story is atomically superseded (one
 *     batch of delivery:reconciled events appended by the caller).
 *
 * Pure: no filesystem, no clock, no side effects. Idempotent.
