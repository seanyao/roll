/**
 * US-DELIV-002 — layered reconcile-from-main: the heart of the delivery
 * reconciler epic. A PURE function that determines delivery truth from
 * layered signals (design §3.3, §4).
 *
 * Invariants:
 * - ≥1 strong signal (L1 PR-state | L2 patch-id) required to declare delivered.
 * - L3 alone (backlog Done + attest) is NEVER sufficient.
 * - When no signal hits, return `wait` — never fabricate a delivery.
 * - main is the single anchor; cycle ledger is a pure projection.
 *
 * Pure: no filesystem, no network, no clock, no side effects.
 * Idempotent: same inputs → same output.
 * Exhaustively unit-testable.

/**
 * Determine delivery truth for one cycle from layered signals.
 *
 * Layered truth determination (design §3.3):
 *   L1 — PR state (MERGED, strongest signal, authoritative).
 *   L2 — patch-id equivalence (squash/rebase-safe, offline-capable).
 *   L3 — backlog Done + attest (weak, cross-check only; NEVER sufficient alone).
 *
 * Decision rules (priority order):
 *   1. PR MERGED → delivered (L1 authoritative; via=external unless the caller
 *      has runner context).
 *   2. branchNetPatchId ∈ mainPatchIds → delivered_external (L2, works offline).
 *      L1+L2 both hit: L1 wins, L2 is corroborating evidence.
 *   3. PR CLOSED (unmerged) → terminal(pr_closed_unmerged) — US-DELIV-010.
 *   4. PR OPEN: draft → degraded(draft); merge conflict →
 *      degraded(merge_conflict); CI green → merge_now; CI red past
 *      {@link CI_STUCK_DWELL_MS} → degraded(ci_stuck); CI red → ci_failed;
 *      mergeable UNKNOWN / CI unknown → wait (transient).
 *   5. gh unreachable auth → degraded(no_permission); other gh errors → wait.
 *   6. Nothing hits → wait (never fabricate delivered). L3 alone is never
 *      sufficient.
 *
 * Guardrails:
 *   - L1/L2 "conflict": L1 MERGED always wins. L2 miss on an amend is expected.
 *   - Uncertain → wait: when prState is undefined AND branchNetPatchId is
 *     undefined, no strong signal is possible → wait.
 *   - US-DELIV-010: degraded/terminal are honest classifications with reason +
 *     dwell for observability and human triage — NEVER delivered, and a
 *     closed/conflicting/draft PR is never merge_now.

 * @param facts - External facts gathered by the IO adapter.
 * @returns A {@link ReconcileResult} — pure, deterministic, idempotent.
