/**
 * Eval candidates — 连续低分 → 待人确认候选 (Goodhart 护栏, US-CORE-013).
 *
 * Direct port of the SIGNAL-emission half of `lib/loop_result_eval.py`
 * (detect_signals, lines 253-335; the signal metadata, lines 254-267). Pure
 * DETECTION: an ordered (oldest→newest) list of result_eval records in, a list
 * of structured improvement SIGNALS out. It never writes the brief, never
 * touches the backlog, never dedups against history — that side-effecting wiring
 * is the loop's (bin/roll dedups on each signal's stable `key`).
 *
 * Goodhart guardrail / human-on-the-loop invariant: a signal is ADVISORY only.
 * It seeds a candidate backlog DRAFT marked 📋 待人确认 (waiting for human
 * confirmation) and is surfaced in the brief — NEVER auto-activating a story,
 * auto-editing code, or auto-modifying the backlog. The candidate writer is
 * injected so core emits the decision + the draft text and the caller persists
 * it (to a signals artifact) without core doing I/O.
 *
 * Detection (py detect_signals, lines 283-335): for each dimension IN
 * {@link DIMENSIONS} ORDER, walk the records newest→oldest counting a LEADING run
 * of known-low (== 0.0) scores; an `unknown`/null score is SKIPPED (neither
 * extends nor breaks the run, so a missing CI signal can't mask a real failing
 * streak); a known-good (> 0.0) score BREAKS the run. A run >= `streak` (default
 * 3) fires one signal. Signals come back in DIMENSIONS order (deterministic,
 * locale-independent).
