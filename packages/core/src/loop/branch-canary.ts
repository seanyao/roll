/**
 * Branch-leak canary (US-LOOP-096) — pure verdict.
 *
 * After US-LOOP-094/095 the healthy steady state is ~0-1 loop worktrees and 0
 * ephemeral local branches (detached cycles create no local branch; rescue is a
 * bundle, not a branch). A climbing count means the cleanup contract broke — the
 * exact failure mode behind the 289-local-branch retro. The canary is a CIRCUIT
 * BREAKER, not just an alert: when it trips, the loop must stop starting new
 * cycles (which would only pile on more) until a human clears the PAUSE.
 *
 * This is a pure data→decision function: the caller gathers the two counts (git
 * branch list filtered by isEphemeralBranch + live loop worktree dirs) and
 * performs the PAUSE-marker write + ALERT the verdict authorizes.
