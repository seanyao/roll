/**
 * US-LOOP-076 (folds in FIX-310) — the RUNNER-OBSERVED cycle signal source.
 *
 * THE BLACK-BOX KILLER. Before this, a cycle's build/TCR phase emitted ZERO
 * structured events: the runner blocked on `await agentSpawn(...)` for the whole
 * agent run (live evidence: a 37-minute cycle with only `cycle:start` then
 * `peer:gate` in events.ndjson) and the only "key node extraction" parsed
 * claude's stream-json — so codex / kimi / pi build phases were invisible. That
 * is a core-thesis violation: a feature must work on a STANDARD model + a thin
 * per-agent normalization layer, and EVERYTHING downstream must be agent-agnostic.
 *
 * The fix here is the agent-agnostic source of truth: the runner OBSERVES the
 * cycle (git commits on the worktree branch, the wall clock) and DERIVES standard
 * {@link RollEvent}s from that observation — it never parses the agent's stdout.
 * One path for EVERY agent. claude's stream-json is no longer privileged; it
 * becomes just one more (optional) normalization source feeding the SAME standard
 * signals the report timeline & `roll cycles --detail` already consume.
 *
 * This module is the pure heart: it takes periodic git snapshots and tracks which
 * commits it has already turned into signals, so a poller can call it on a timer
 * and only the NEW turning points become events. No clock, no FS, no git here —
 * the caller (the runner adapter) supplies the snapshot and the timestamp, so the
 * logic is deterministic and table-testable.
