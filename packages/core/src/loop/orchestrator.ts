/**
 * CycleOrchestrator — TS port of the v2 loop "inner cycle runner" (US-LOOP-001).
 *
 * This is the COMPOSITION card: nearly every building block already exists as a
 * pure module (backlog/picker, agent/router, delivery/{pr,tcr}, reconcile/engine,
 * events/bus, loop/recovery). This module is the conductor — a PURE
 * state machine that walks the {@link CyclePhase} ladder, deciding at each step
 * WHICH building-block command to run next and WHAT terminal {@link TerminalOutcome}
 * the cycle lands on. It NEVER spawns a process, sleeps, or reads a clock; every
 * I/O result (story pick, route, worktree create, agent exit, publish status,
 * merge poll, reconcile evidence) is fed back in as an {@link CycleEvent}, and the
 * stepper returns the next state + an ordered list of {@link CycleCommand}s for an
 * injected executor (the CLI/infra adapter) to perform.

 *
 * Two phases the spec names but v2 folds differently:
 *   - "merge-wait": v2 (US-AUTO-044, bin/roll:9241-9250) HANDS the merged PR to a
 *     separate async PR Loop rather than blocking the cycle. The pre-AUTO-044
 *     SYNCHRONOUS wait (`_loop_wait_pr_merge`, bin/roll:13580-13599) is already
 *     ported as delivery/pr.ts {@link nextWaitAction}. This orchestrator models
 *     merge-wait as an OPTIONAL phase (driven by {@link nextWaitAction}) so a
 *     caller can choose the synchronous shape (the card's "等真合并") OR the
 *     hand-off shape; the default walk hands off (v2 today) and treats `done` as
 *     "published, merge handed to PR Loop", with reconcile crediting built→merged
 *     on real evidence (reconcile/engine.ts {@link reconcileMergeEvidence}, I4).
 *   - "reconcile": v2 does the per-cycle status capture inline (bin/roll:9127-9157)
 *     and the real merge backfill in a SEPARATE pass (`_loop_backfill_merged`).
 *     Here `reconcile` is the phase that classifies the six-state terminal from
 *     the captured facts ({@link classifyCaptured}) and, when synchronous, folds
 *     merge evidence.
 *
 * ── Terminal outcome model ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * v2 stamps one of SIX runs.jsonl statuses (idle/built/failed/orphan/aborted/done)
 * — see _runs_append callers + the EXIT trap. {@link classifyCaptured} and
 * {@link captureToSpecOutcome} map v2 runner rows to TerminalOutcome. The
 * {@link V2CycleStatus} internal vocabulary is kept for byte-faithful runs-row
 * parity; emitted cycle:end events and new row `outcome` fields use the closed
 * terminal vocabulary.
 *
 * ── Hard timeout (B-group AC) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * v2 LOOP_CYCLE_TIMEOUT_SEC=2700 (bin/roll:8473). The watchdog (bin/roll:9044-9052)
 * SIGTERMs the inner script at the breach, SIGKILLs after a 5s grace; the EXIT
 * trap then writes cycle_end `blocked` + ALERT and releases the inner lock WITHOUT
 * cleaning the worktree (preserved for audit, bin/roll:9122). {@link watchdogVerdict}
 * is the pure breach decision; {@link timeoutTeardownCommands} renders the clean
 * teardown command sequence (kill → terminal event → lock release), order-asserted
 * in tests. The OUTER guard (bin/roll:9562, timeout+300) is the adapter's; this
 * module owns the INNER decision.
 *
 * ── Transient retry / backoff (B-group AC, I6) ────────────────────────────────
 * v2's `for _attempt in 1 2 3` (bin/roll:9032-9072) is a PROCESS-EXIT retry: any
 * non-zero agent exit (that is not a timeout) retries up to 3 times with a FIXED
 * 30s sleep (bin/roll:9070), then falls through to `failed`. It does NOT classify
 * transient-vs-permanent and does NOT swap agents on failure (I6: in-cycle bounded
 * retry is SEPARATE from the loop-level consecutive-failure PAUSE — agent swap is a
 * PRE-SPAWN availability fallback only, router.ts {@link resolveFallback}).
 * {@link retryPlan} mirrors v2's 3-attempt budget and adds an EXPONENTIAL backoff
 * schedule (NEW v3: the AC+ asks for "退避"; v2 uses a flat 30s, kept as the base).
 * Exhaustion → `failed` (NEVER agent-swap — I6). The timeout breach short-circuits
 * the retry loop (bin/roll:9066 `break`), so a timed-out attempt is NOT retried.
 *
 * ── No cost gate (budget control removed) ─────────────────────────────────────
 * v2 had NO cost gate in the runner, and v3 no longer adds one: the dollar
 * ceiling was a lagging, gameable proxy for "this run is wasting resources".
 * route_resolved now transitions straight to the agent spawn. Runaway-spend
 * protection moved to the DIRECT progress guardrails in loop-go.ts (the
 * per-cycle productivity floor + the cross-session dead-loop breaker), which
 * stop the loop on NO PROGRESS — earlier and deterministically. Per-cycle
 * token/cost is still fully RECORDED (cost/tracker.ts → runs.jsonl); only the
 * CONTROL was removed, not the observability.
 *
 * Purity: no spawn, no sleep, no clock, no fs. The stepper is a referentially
 * transparent `(state, event) → { state, commands }`. Callers thread the returned
 * state back in with the next observed event; the {@link CycleCommand}s name the
 * existing ports/plans so the adapter dispatches them 1:1.

 *               (bin/roll:9133/9209/9219).

// 46min after one TCR commit). FIX-907 races the spawn against this decision so
// a hung builder is killed and the lock freed without human intervention.
//

//   (a) WALL — total cycle elapsed exceeds the hard ceiling (default 45min).

//       on pure elapsed time: a slow `deepseek` call sits at 0% CPU but keeps
