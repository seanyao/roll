/**
 * Remote branch GC — narrow "delete stranded loop/cycle-* remote branches"
 * decision (US-LOOP-097, "方案 1 窄 D").
 *
 * `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch` already removes the remote head when a
 * PR merges. This GC only sweeps the LEFTOVERS: loop/cycle branches that never
 * got (or lost) a PR. The danger (agy/cursor review) is that "no open PR" is NOT
 * sufficient — there are LEGITIMATE no-PR remote branches this must NOT delete:
 *   - FIX-1214 degraded publish: pushed, PR create deferred → in pending-pr-create.
 *   - orphan push: work deliberately parked on the remote for audit/resume.
 *   - a branch just pushed seconds ago, PR not opened yet (age grace).
 * So a branch is deletable ONLY when it clears EVERY guard below. Pure decision;
 * the adapter gathers the sets and performs `git push origin --delete`.
