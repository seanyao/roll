 * signal comes from the independent REVIEWER (it enumerates the uncovered AC /
 * coverage gaps after the builder self-declares done at ~80%). This module adds
 * that trigger EDGE — it does not build a new downgrade machine: the actual
 * re-split is performed by `roll loop self-downgrade` (US-AGENT-042) and the
 * chain-depth cap is US-AGENT-009's, both reused unchanged.
 *
 * The split PROPOSAL is gated by HETEROGENEOUS CONSENSUS instead of a
 * human-confirm: ≥2 different-vendor agents review it (reusing the existing
 * peer-review primitive) — ALL agree → auto-land; any objection → pause + alert
 * (human on the loop, not in it). See [[feedback_hetero_consensus_replaces_human_confirm]].
 *
 * Purity: parsing + decisions only; the command wires design (`$roll-design`),
 * the peer consult spawns, and the self-downgrade side-effects.
