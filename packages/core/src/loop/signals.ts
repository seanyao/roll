/**
 * US-PORT-012 — the single signal口径 ("一处定义两处消费").
 *
 * One table decides "what is a turning-point signal" for the whole loop. Two
 * consumers read it so the key nodes never drift between surfaces:
 *
 *   - {@link extractCycleSignals} (transcript.ts) — reduces the RollEvent stream
 *     into the acceptance-report timeline; its `signal`-layer entries are
 *     exactly the markers {@link signalKindForMarker} classifies.
 *   - the observation-window formatter (loop-fmt.ts) — folds the agent's raw
 *     stream-json into a three-tier tmux transcript; its Tier-1 lines carry the
 *     SAME {@link SignalKind} values.
 *
 * So a TCR commit (or a CI gate, a PR merge, an ALERT) shows up under one shared
 * vocabulary in both the report's timeline and the live watch window — defined
 * here once, consumed in both places.
