/**
 * roll release — version + flow planning (US-PORT-004, TS port).
 *
 * TWO version schemes live here (FIX-1247):
 *
 *   - calver — roll's OWN build-number scheme `<major>.<MMDD>.<seq>` (e.g.
 *     `3.606.2` = major 3, June 6, the 2nd release that day). This is roll's
 *     internal cadence and MUST NOT leak onto the projects roll releases.
 *   - semver — the DEFAULT for every other (target/user) project: bump the
 *     patch of the project's own `<major>.<minor>.<patch>` lineage, and give a
 *     sensible initial value on first release. roll serves user projects (see
 *     roll_serves_user_projects), so a target project's version must anchor to
 *     the TARGET's package.json, never to roll's build number — releasing
 *     intel-radar must not produce `4.713.1`/`0.713.1`.
 *
 * The scheme is chosen from the project being released ({@link resolveVersionScheme}):
 * only roll's own package resolves to calver; everything else is semver.
 * package.json is the single source of truth for the running version (see
 * packages/cli/src/commands/version.ts).
 *
 * These are PURE functions (no I/O, no clock): the date is always passed in so
 * they unit-test deterministically. The CLI adapter (packages/cli) reads the
 * current version + changelog state and supplies `new Date()`.
 *
 * `roll release` is READ-ONLY GUIDANCE — it computes the next version, surfaces
 * changelog readiness, and prints the ordered PR/tag flow. It never pushes a
 * tag or publishes: tagging triggers release.yml's consistency-gate and the
 * actual publish requires the maintainer's 2FA. This mirrors the loop's hard
 * rule — a release is always a human decision, never autonomous.
