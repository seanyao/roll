/**
 * US-V4-009 — Supervisor parallel-cycle scheduling (PURE decision).
 *
 * SCOPE NOTE (v4.0 vs v4.1): this module is the minimal, SAFE deliverable for
 * US-V4-009 — the pure scheduling DECISION. The LIVE integration into the loop
 * runner (actually spawning concurrent cycles, parallel-cycle crash recovery)
 * is deferred to v4.1: it touches the loop's hard-won concurrency/locking
 * reliability and must not ship until Supervisor v0 (US-V4-008) is proven stable
 * in real runs. The architecture (§16 M8) and the US-V4-009 spec both mark
 * parallel scheduling v4.1-eligible. This decision layer is what that future
 * integration will call; it preserves every Loop/Cycle invariant by construction:
 *   - never exceeds `maxParallelCycles`;
 *   - one Story has at most one open PR/Cycle (single-ownership);
 *   - file/path conflicts serialize (a candidate overlapping an active cycle waits);
 *   - merge-queue depth ≥ cap, or budget exhausted, pauses NEW starts.
 * Manual override stays available because the caller decides whether to act on
 * the decision (the scheduler never spawns anything itself).
