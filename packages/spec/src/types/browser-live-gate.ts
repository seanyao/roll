/**
 * US-BROW-020 — Live managed-lane regression gate evidence contract.
 *
 * This is the structured-evidence vocabulary for the real local Chrome +
 * chrome-devtools-mcp integration suite. The suite must be impossible to
 * satisfy with a fixture: the gate verdict is only ever `verified` when a
 * REAL pinned MCP transport initialized, its tool manifest was verified, and
 * every scenario cleaned up its MCP, Chrome and temporary profile.
 *
 * The contrast this contract enforces:
 *   - `transportInitialized` — a real stdio MCP process completed `initialize`.
 *   - `manifestVerified`      — real `tools/list` matched the pinned manifest.
 *   - artifact `kind`s        — which diagnostic artifacts the real lane produced.
 *   - `cleanup`               — MCP / Chrome / temp-profile teardown state.
 *
 * A `fixture` source can populate the same shape, but a fixture source can
 * never produce a `verified` verdict (see `LiveGateResult`). "No assertion may
 * pass solely because a fixture returned the expected shape" (AC4).

 * Whether the current environment can host the real live suite.

 * The suite needs a real Chrome/Chromium binary and the ability to spawn the
 * pinned `chrome-devtools-mcp` package (npx present). When it cannot, the gate
 * fails LOUD as an explicitly-unavailable environment gate — it must never be
 * silently skipped while reporting the feature verified (AC5).
