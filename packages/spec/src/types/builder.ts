/**
 * FIX-1068 — Builder finalization hard gate.
 *
 * These types formalize the adapter-agnostic contract that runs after every
 * Builder subprocess exits and before peer review, scoring, attest, PR creation,
 * cleanup, or delivery recording. The gate turns the raw worktree/branch facts
 * into a single verdict so the runner can fail-loud on boundary violations,
 * preserve recoverable handoff work, and avoid killing active builders that are
 * still making progress.
