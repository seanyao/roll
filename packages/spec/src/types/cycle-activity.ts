/**
 * US-OBS-026 — the standard cycle activity projection type.
 *
 * THREE-STREAM AUTHORITY BOUNDARY (the keystone contract):
 *
 *   1. `events.ndjson` = SINGLE DURABLE TRUTH source.
 *      Every loop cycle appends structured {@link RollEvent}s here;
 *      all state is rebuilt from this stream. Never a cache, never
 *      a secondary store. Runner-written facts (cycle:phase,
 *      cycle:first_edit, cycle:tcr, cycle:stdout, cycle:end, ci:*,
 *      pr:*, peer:gate, attest:gate) are agent-agnostic and durable.
 *
 *   2. `ActivitySignal` = PROJECTION model.
 *      Derived FROM the durable truth (RollEvent stream) OR from a
 *      per-agent raw-stream normalizer. Downstream renderers (watch
 *      window, static archive, cycle ledger) consume ONLY ActivitySignal
 *      — never agent-specific parsing. This is the rich UI model
 *      with tier / seg / summary / result / ref / signalKind.
 *
 *   3. `live.log` = RAW TRANSCRIPT / DEBUG ATTACHMENT.
 *      A passthrough of the agent's stdout. NOT truth — never
 *      participates in judgment, scoring, or evidence decisions.
 *      Debug-only; may be incomplete, truncated, or missing.
 *
 * This module defines {@link CycleActivityEvent} — the STANDARD
 * projection from durable events (events.ndjson) into a structured,
 * agent-agnostic cycle-activity stream. It is a DISCRIMINATED UNION
 * keyed on `kind`, built ON the existing {@link RollEvent} vocabulary
 * (no parallel type system). Every variant carries `cycle_id` / `ts` /
 * `agent` / `payload`.
 *
 * The projection function {@link cycleActivityFromEvents} (in
 * `@roll/core`) maps `RollEvent[] → CycleActivityEvent[]` using ONLY
 * the agent-agnostic durable facts already in events.ndjson. It does
 * NOT depend on any per-agent normalizer — claude, codex, kimi, pi,
 * and future agents all work from the same source of truth.
