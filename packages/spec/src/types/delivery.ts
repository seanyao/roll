/**
 * US-TRUTH-013 — Structured Delivery Record + Lifecycle State enumeration.
 *
 * This is the foundation of the structured-truth-review epic: the machine-managed
 * delivery truth lives as a strong-schema record, NOT parsed from markdown prose.
 *
 * Two orthogonal dimensions (pi clarified in the 3-agent review):
 *   - LifecycleState: WHERE the card is in the delivery pipeline (machine-derived).
 *   - TruthState (truth.ts selectors): the VERDICT on whether a claim matches
 *     the facts (truth/warn/fail/unknown/grandfathered).
 *
 * These are independent fields that must NOT be conflated — a card can be
 * `in_flight` (lifecycle) AND `warn` (verdict, because its claim lagged).
 *
 * Lifecycle is DERIVED from TerminalOutcome + PR state via lifecycleFromFacts(),
 * never hand-set — no second vocabulary.
