/**
 * US-ATTEST-015 — Outward behavior verification types.
 *
 * An "outward" AC is a behavior that cannot be verified locally (e.g. real
 * `npm install`, published CLI startup, OAuth callback). Outward ACs must
 * carry an explicit verification declaration (external-smoke or owner-attested);
 * the system never infers outward from prose.
 *
 * The status ladder below feeds the attest report AcStatus ladder (§report.ts)
 * but adds an enforcement layer: simulation-only or skipped manual work must
 * never promote to a positive AC status. These types are pure schema — the
 * validator and resolver live in @roll/core.
