/**
 * US-TRUTH-006 — the change-point guardrail: persistent fact FIELDS register
 * their authority/source/cache semantics, and CI fails loud when a new field
 * lands unregistered.
 *
 * Drift recurs because a feature "just adds" a runs column, an event field, or
 * a dashboard counter without declaring whether it is authoritative fact or a
 * derived view — the next consumer then guesses, and the guess diverges
 * (the whole FIX-243/244/248/249 family). The rule:
 *
 *   any field that is PERSISTED and read by a second place must appear here,
 *   bound to its US-TRUTH-000 anchor; a derived-cache field must say how it
 *   rebuilds. Local variables and single-reader temp files don't register.
 *
 * The guard is mechanical: tests construct REAL rows/events via the production
 * builders and assert every key is registered (or explicitly grandfathered).
 * Adding a field without registering it turns CI red with a pointer here —
 * never a silent skip (AC3). Registration is cheap and deliberate; that's the
 * point.
