/**
 * US-TRUTH-000 — Truth Source Declaration (the field-level authority matrix).
 *
 * Roll's drift epidemic (FIX-243/244/248/249; the 2026-06-10 day where every
 * delivered cycle died on the books while its PRs merged) is a WRITE-side
 * problem: several sources write and interpret the same fact. This module is
 * the single declaration of, per persistent fact field:
 *
 *   - which source is AUTHORITATIVE (everything else is a derived view),
 *   - who the one legitimate WRITER is,
 *   - how a CONFLICT between views arbitrates,
 *   - when a missing/late value is legally `unknown` (never silently 0/fail),
 *   - whether the field can be REBUILT from its source.
 *
 * Selectors (US-TRUTH-003), the shadow audit (US-TRUTH-002) and the release
 * gate (US-TRUTH-005) consume THIS table — they must not invent a new one.
 * The prose twin lives at
 * `.roll/features/feedback-truth-alignment/truth-anchors.md`; the registry in
 * code is canonical (tests enforce coverage; prose explains).
 *
 * Core principles (epic ruling, peer-reviewed 2026-06-11):
 *   1. main is the delivery truth — but not the home of every evidence field.
 *   2. one authoritative writer per fact; everything else is a rebuildable view.
 *   3. `unknown` is a legal state (API down / window not yet converged).
